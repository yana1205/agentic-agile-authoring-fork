"""MyHarness deployer: reuse APM's core as a library, own only the deployment diff (§3.3).

APM's deployment targets are a closed, hardcoded registry with no plugin mechanism — an unknown
target slug is rejected. We do **not** fork APM. But APM's manifest-load and MCP-normalization are
target-agnostic, so for a custom harness ("MyHarness") we import the pinned APM as a *library* to
get the normalized MCP model, then do the small deployment ourselves:

    resolved skill package + normalized MCP   (APM library)
            │
            ├── copy skill bundle → <root>/skills/<name>/
            └── merge normalized MCP → <root>/mcp.json   (non-destructive)

Library entry points (verified @ apm-cli 0.28.0, see .insights/installer-node-vs-python.md):
``apm_cli.models.apm_package.APMPackage.from_apm_yml(Path)`` →
``.get_all_mcp_dependencies()`` → ``MCPDependency.to_dict()`` (a target-agnostic normalized dict).
Each local skill package is self-contained, so we normalize per-package directly and don't need
the full ``APMDependencyResolver`` graph (which is for transitive git/registry deps we don't use).

Ownership: the only MyHarness-local state is *which MCP servers we wrote*, tracked in an
``_compliance_authoring_skills`` provenance block inside ``mcp.json``. Prune reuses APM's reachability idea — recompute
the required MCP set from the currently-installed skills' manifests and drop only servers no
surviving skill needs, never touching user-authored servers.
