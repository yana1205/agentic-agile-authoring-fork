# Git Workflow for OSCAL Compliance Documents

## Purpose
Provide version control and change tracking for OSCAL compliance documents using a two-branch strategy: baseline (`<id>-initial`) and review (`<id>-review`) branches.

## Important: Opt-in Only
**This workflow is NOT executed by default.** Only use when user explicitly requests:
- "Use Git for version control"
- "Create a PR at the end"
- "I want to track changes with Git"
- Or similar explicit requests

**Default behavior**: Skip all Git operations unless specifically requested.

## Default Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup (After Markdown Deployment)
Create baseline branch to establish change tracking foundation:

```sh
git checkout -b "<id>-initial"
git add -A && git commit -m "<message>"
```

**Purpose**: Establish a baseline for tracking changes.

### Phase 2: Review (After Editing Completion)
Create review branch and pull request for change review:

**Note**: Direct commits to `<id>-initial` are prohibited (protected branch)

```sh
git checkout <id>-initial
git checkout -b <id>-review
git add -A && git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin <id>-initial <id>-review
gh pr create --base <id>-initial --head <id>-review
```

**Best Practice**: Squash multiple commits into one before creating the PR.

## Branch Naming Convention

- `<id>-initial`: Baseline branch containing the initial state
- `<id>-review`: Review branch containing your changes

Replace `<id>` with a meaningful identifier for the compliance document or project (e.g., "nist-800-53-low", "fedramp-moderate").

## Rules

- Never execute Git operations unless user explicitly requests
- Always confirm branch identifier `<id>` with user before creating branches
- Protect `<id>-initial` branch from direct commits
- Use descriptive commit messages referencing control IDs when possible
- Squash commits before PR creation for clean history

## When to Recommend This Workflow

Suggest this workflow when:
- User mentions formal change tracking or review processes
- Multiple people are collaborating on compliance documents
- User needs clear audit trail of changes
- Organization requires pull request reviews

## Alternative Approaches

If this workflow doesn't fit user needs:
- Use custom Git branching strategy
- Commit directly to a single branch
- Use different version control system
- Skip version control entirely for simple projects

## Integration Points

This workflow integrates with the `catalog-authoring` skill's phases:
- Phase 1 Setup: Execute after the initial markdown deployment (`trestle_author_catalog_generate` / `trestle_author_profile_generate`), once the baseline artifacts exist.
- Phase 2 Edit: Execute after parameter editing and catalog regeneration (`trestle_author_profile_assemble`).
